# MAYGEN

Copyright 2021 Mehmet Aziz Yirik

## Introduction

MAYGEN is an open source chemical structure generator based on the orderly graph generation method. The principles of this method were outlined in the works by Grund et al. [1]. The theoretical basis and the outlines of the functions can be found in [1,2].  
MAYGEN takes a molecular formula (such as C10H16O) as input and generates all constitutional isomers of this formula, i. e. all non-isomorphic molecules that can be constructed with the set of atoms in the input formula. For the case of C10H16O, for example, there are 452,458 non-identical molecules.

## Download jar File

The main class of the current jar file is MAYGEN class. The file can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/MehmetAzizYirik/MAYGEN/releases/tag/V1.0)

## Download Source Code

You can download the source code as a ZIP file from the landing page of this repository. 
Alternatively, you can clone the repository using GIT. For more information [set-up-git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/ )

To download MAYGEN source code:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MehmetAzizYirik/MAYGEN.git
```
## Compiling

To compile MAYGEN, Apache Maven and Java 1.8 (or later) are required.
```
MAYGEN/$ mvn package
```
This command will create jar file named as "MAYGEN-jar-with-dependencies" under the target folder.

## Usage

MAYGEN.jar can be run from command line with the specified arguments. An example command is given below.

The definitions of the arguments are given below:

```
usage: java -jar MAYGEN.jar -f <arg> [-v] -d <arg>

Generates molecular structures for a given molecular formula. The input is 
a molecular formula string. For example 'C2OH4'. Besides molecular formula, the
directory is needed to be specified for the output file.

 -f,--molecularFormula <arg>   Molecular formula as a string (required)
 
 -v,--verbose                  Print messages about structure generation
 
 -d,--filedir <arg>            Creates and store the output txt file 
                               in the directory 

Please report issues at https://github.com/MehmetAzizYirik/MAYGEN
